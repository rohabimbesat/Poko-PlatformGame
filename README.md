# POKO 

Our game, Poko, is a platform-type game, where you control a ghost-like character called Poko through different levels. 
The aim of the game is to guide Poko through different levels to get to the end platform, whilst not dying by avoiding spikes
 and moving enemies. Poko is able to shoot enemies and collect supply crates in order to regenerate ammo and lives.

The game includes 4 hard coded levels, which increase in difficulty and one option for the user to upload their own level through a text file. 
The game can be played in single player or multiplayer, limited to two players.
